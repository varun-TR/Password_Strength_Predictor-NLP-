# NLP Password Strength Predictor

## Overview
The NLP Password Strength Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at evaluating and predicting the strength of passwords using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages advanced NLP methods to analyze passwords and classify their strength into predefined categories such as weak, medium, and strong.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess password data, including handling missing values and normalizing text.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize techniques like TF-IDF to transform password text data into meaningful features.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models, including RandomForestClassifier, to predict password strength.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as confusion matrices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language used for development.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
